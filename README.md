# FarmCare
##Inspiration

According to the UN, Nearly 1/2 of all fruit & vegetables produced globally are wasted each year. With decreasing energy and resources across the planet, Farm Care was made to promote better yield among farmers and better health among malnourished people and animals.

## What it does
It consists of 3 modules -   
**1. Soil Type Detection -** It is used to detect the type of soil in your farm.  
**2. Pest Detection -** It is used to detect the pests you found in your farm.  
**3. Plat Disease Detection -** It is used to detect the disease which your plant has caught.  

## How we built it
✅ We built the Machine learning model using images. We have used various types of image processing and image segmentation algorithms to find the soil type from the image.

✅ Website is built using a html, css, python, flask and machine learning models.

✅ Built disease prediction model using image segmentation and plant disease model.

✅ Built Pest prediction model using image segmentation and plant disease model.

## Challenges we ran into

While we were working on this project the limited availability of data sets was a big problem we faced. Build different ML model for different diseases detection was another huge problem

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The implementation of the entire project helped us realize the importance of collaboration and the dynamics of working in a team. In every Hackathon, proper time management ⏰plays a crucial role that can become a determining factor for the overall progress. We understood the instrumentality of following the code of conduct ✨and treating fellow developers with respect while learning and improving through their feedback. We are proud of completing the project in time.

## What we learned

We learnt about how to take Machine Learning to the next level by using it with front end and backend development to empower our project and make it usable for everyone around the world. The major takeaway was about how we can use our skillset and help the planet be a better place

## What's next for FARM CARE
We plan on adding more features and also plan on adding an on-site bot to answer your queries.
